# Real detached playback: the one surface whose bugs are PROCESSES, not output. Everything
# here starts real mpv players — silent (--volume 0), in a state dir of their own, and the run
# does not pass until `pgrep` comes back empty: a leaked mpv is the failure this file exists
# to catch.
#
# No gate. It used to sit behind YT_TEST_LIFECYCLE=1 because starting players meant starting
# them ON TOP OF the user's — --stop --all reached whatever they were listening to. The state
# dir below removes that, and what is left is a run that needs the network — a reason to run it
# when the player changed, not a reason for an env var to guard it.
#
# It also owns two claims contract.sh's offline half can never reach, both for the same
# reason — they need players that are really running: that a mutation with no `--id` and two
# players answers `status:"ambiguous"` (4 alone does not separate it from an idle call), and
# ARCH-cli-contract.md「调用面」's `t-playlist --show … -j | t-play -d --queue -`, run
# verbatim — contract.sh proves that envelope reaches the gate, this is where it launches.
#
# Cost: no figure is kept here — a total quoted in a header goes stale the first time a check
# is added, and the run that measures it is the one that should say it. What is stable is
# WHERE the time goes: live engine resolves (t-play's run_mpv records the measured median
# between tracks) and the listening-log section playing a 19-second track out to its own end
# rather than seeking there — that section cannot seek, because `duration` is null on a live
# stream and a check must not go green or red on whether the track was streaming that
# afternoon. Neither is reducible without a stand-in, and this
# file has none. What IS reducible is waiting on one player while another could be starting,
# so the single-handle players launch back to back and are polled by --id afterwards.
#
# EVERY WAIT HERE IS A BOUNDED POLL, on a 0.25s tick. There is exactly one fixed sleep left and
# it is not a wait — it is SETUP, and it says so where it sits. A fixed guess costs twice: it is
# too long on a fast machine and red on a merely slow one, and a red that is not a bug still
# costs somebody an investigation.
#
# And it carries the one claim that needs a SECOND source: that the player applies the
# http_headers an engine hands it. See the Bilibili section for why only that site can show it.
#
# It also owns the LIVE READ (--status off the mpv socket), for the same reason: the peer is
# real mpv or it is nothing. The suite keeps no stand-in for a component, so a claim about
# talking to mpv can only be made where mpv is running — which is here, and only here. That
# now includes `media` — what is actually decoding — which exists in no record and in no
# engine envelope at all, so this file is the only place it can be proved to exist.

# Why, once, for all three files under tests/: contract.sh's header. Here it earns
# the sharpest form of the same sentence — every --stop --all below would reach the player the
# user is listening to, and every orphan count would be a count of THEIR mpv.
#
# EVERY INHERITED TING_*/UT_* NAME IS DROPPED FIRST, before this file sets any of its own. Each
# one is a config key the loader reads from the environment ahead of any file, so a developer's
# exported UT_DEFAULT_ENGINE or UT_HISTORY=0 beats the empty config below and steers every
# check without appearing anywhere in the run; TING_* is worse, because it outranks the UT_
# names this file exports and would put its redirection back on the real files. A sweep over
# the whole namespace rather than a list, because a list is only as complete as the day it was
# written. The checks that prove a particular name works set it themselves, one command at a
# time. `compgen -v` rather than parsing `env`: it lists NAMES, so a value with a newline in it
# cannot forge a line that looks like one.

# And the USER-LEVEL store, for the same reason one line up but a longer-lived consequence:
# a detached player writes a row to the listening log for every track it finishes, so without
# this every run of this file would append a dozen tracks nobody listened to into the user's
# real history — and unlike a player, a log is not something --stop takes back.
export UT_STATE_DIR="$UT_TEST_TMP/state"

# AND THE USER'S OWN CONFIG FILE, which is the third thing this run must not read — the one
# that was missed. Every default this file leans on comes from the four-level chain, and the
# user's own file wins over the shipped one: a `UT_DEFAULT_ENGINE=bili` written there by
# `ting`'s own e key (it writes that key back) sends every YouTube handle below to
# `bili-resolve`, which refuses the host, and 23 checks go red saying nothing whatsoever about
# the player. That is not hypothetical — it is what this file did on the machine that added
# the paragraph, and the failures named sockets and volumes rather than the config that
# caused them. An EMPTY file, not an unset variable: unset means "read ~/.config/ting/config"
# and empty means "the shipped defaults, and nothing a person happened to prefer".
# contract.sh has isolated this from the start; this file had not. The environment half of the
# same chain was swept at the top of this block.
