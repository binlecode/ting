# The CLI contract, asserted by RUNNING it. No rig: a command-line tool is tested by
# invoking it and reading its exit code and its stdout, which is all this file does.
#
# What it covers: the search envelope's shape, every documented rejection (a flag on the
# wrong verb, a bare query where a URL belongs, two actions at once, a selector with no
# action), the read-only --transcript verb both ways, the idle lifecycle, the shape of the
# tombstone record (its behavior is playback.sh's), --version, the non-TTY refusal, the failure
# taxonomy — 1 is usage, 2 is a tool that failed, and the two engines' envelopes agreeing
# key for key — and the documented PIPELINES between commands, run rather than printed
# (ARCH-cli-contract.md「调用面」; the one that launches a player is playback.sh's).
#
# This replaced a skill that carried the same commands as prose for an agent to copy out by
# hand. That version rotted silently: it listed a resident socket server as a check (it hangs
# and asserts nothing), asserted the same exit code in two phases, described the network path
# in a sentence with no command behind it, referenced capture files that were never made, and
# had no coverage at all for --transcript. A test suite that cannot be executed reports green
# by default, which is worse than having none.
#
# Portability: bash 3.2 (macOS system bash). No bash-4 idioms; see docs/ARCHITECTURE.md「可移植性契约」.
#
# Cost, measured 2026-09-23 on the author's machine: ~150s in full (571 checks), of which
# `--offline` is the first 41-46s with no packet sent. The live half is dominated by real
# engine round trips (2-8s each) and the tmux TUI panes, which each wait for a real search and
# a real first frame. The total count moves by a few between runs, and that is not sloppiness:
# a handful of checks report only when today's results give them something to report (a
# chapterless row, a view that opens, a parts view to read a total off), and the alternative
# to skipping them is a check that cannot fail on the days the site is generous. A skip line
# names each one, and 0 failed is the number that means passing. The biggest single item in
# the offline half is one deliberate 5.5s lock spin — a FRESH held lock has to be waited out,
# that being what the spin is for; the stale-lock steal beside it costs 0.1s because
# staleness is tested before the spin, not after (shell/t-playlist:lock_playlist).
#
# Per-SECTION figures are deliberately absent: this file's output is block-buffered the moment
# it is piped or redirected, so timestamping its section headers dates the flush, not the work.
# The two totals above are wall-clock around the whole command, which is the only shape of
# this measurement that survives being taken.
#
# Numbers in this paragraph have been wrong before, three at once — ~80s for the full run,
# "one 5s lock spin" where three were paid, "~25s of tmux" for 4s of it — which is its own
# lesson: a cost comment is a claim, and this file's rule is that a claim gets executed, not
# read.
# It starts no process it did not have to and talks to no peer — every live claim is
# tests/playback.sh's.
# The TUI section is the near-exception and is held to the same line: the process there is a
# real `ting` on a real tty, it is CHECKED to leave no player behind, and the EXIT trap reaps
# one if it ever does.
#
# Usage:  tests/contract.sh            all checks
#         tests/contract.sh --offline  the hermetic half only — every gate, both stores, the
#                                      idle lifecycle, and no packet sent
# Exit:   0 = every check held, 1 = at least one regression

# ---- the player's state dir, pointed somewhere disposable ---------------------------
# THE ARGUMENT FOR THIS LIVES HERE, and the other two files under tests/ point at it rather
# than restating it. ARCHITECTURE.md「风险登记」 carries the one-line risk row; this is its why.
#
# `t-play` derives its state dir from TMPDIR ("${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/ting-$(id -u)", shell/t-play)
# and takes no override of its own. Left at the user's real TMPDIR, this file --stop --all's a
# player they are listening to, touches players in their real players/, and
# rm -rf's their real failure record — three side effects on live user state, in a suite whose
# instruction is "run it before every commit".
#
# Redirecting TMPDIR is what makes that instruction safe. It changes nothing about WHAT is
# invoked or asserted: the player is the real one and its state is really written, just not on
# top of the user's. The playlist store already had this in UT_STATE_DIR; the half that kills
# processes is the half that needed it more.
UT_TEST_TMP=$(mktemp -d "${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/ting-contract.XXXXXX") || exit 1
export TMPDIR="$UT_TEST_TMP"
STATE_DIR="$TMPDIR/ting-$(id -u)"

# ---- the config file, pointed somewhere disposable ----------------------------------
# The same argument as TMPDIR above, one layer out. Every command in the suite now reads
# ${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-~/.config}/ting/config, so without this line a developer whose real
# config sets UT_MAX_SEARCH_RESULTS or UT_SORT_FIELD would see this file go red on their
# machine and green on everyone else's — the worst failure a suite can have, because the
# red is not in the subject. It points at a real, EMPTY file rather than a missing path so
# the loader's read path is the one exercised for the rest of the run; the checks that
# prove the loader actually loads something write their own file and set UT_CONFIG
# themselves.
# TING_* is DROPPED rather than mirrored, and that is the whole isolation story in one line:
# every export below is a UT_ name, and TING_ now outranks UT_ in the loader — so a developer
# with TING_CONFIG or TING_STATE_DIR exported would have this file's own redirection silently
# overruled and would run against their real files. The checks that prove the TING_ names work
# set them themselves, one command at a time.
unset TING_CONFIG TING_STATE_DIR
export UT_CONFIG="$UT_TEST_TMP/config"
: > "$UT_CONFIG"

# ---- …and the real one, WATCHED --------------------------------------------------------
# The export above redirects every command this shell runs. It does not reach a tmux pane —
# a new session inherits the tmux SERVER's environment, not this shell's, which is why the
# TUI section passes its own knobs explicitly — and it does not reach whatever a future check
# forks in a way nobody predicted here. That gap used to be harmless because nothing in the
# suite WROTE a config; ting now writes eleven preference keys back to the user's file, so an
# unisolated caller does not merely read a developer's config, it edits it, and the value it
# leaves is one they never chose.
#
# Two fingerprints around the whole run catch ANY such caller, including one added long after
# this line was written — which is exactly what three call sites each remembering to export
# cannot do. cksum rather than a timestamp: it is POSIX (macOS `stat` and GNU `stat` do not
# share a format string), and the claim is that the file's CONTENT is the one the user left.
#
# BOTH spellings are watched, not just the one this checkout would create. The rename gave
# the loader a two-name chain (ting first, the pre-rename uting second), so which file a
# leaked write lands in depends on the developer's machine, not on this suite — and a guard
# that watches only one of them is green on exactly the machine it was meant to protect.

# then PRESENT is a fail, which is the shape a leaked write takes on that same machine.

}

# ---- …and the real STATE DIR, watched the same way ------------------------------------
# The config file got this guard when ting learned to write one. The playlist store and the
# listening log have been writable by every check in this file since long before that, and
# they had no guard at all — the discipline was three sections each remembering to point
# UT_STATE_DIR somewhere disposable, which is exactly the kind of discipline that holds until
# it doesn't. It didn't: a section added after the one that ends with `unset UT_STATE_DIR`
# assigned the variable without exporting it, and every t-playlist call in it went to the
# user's real store and left a playlist there.
#
# So the same two fingerprints the config gets, around the same run, over the whole state
# tree. `ls -R` piped through cksum rather than the files' contents: what must not change is
# WHICH lists and logs exist, and a real listening session running in another window will
# legitimately grow today's .jsonl while this file runs. A name appearing or vanishing is the
# shape a leak takes, and it is the shape this catches.
# Both spellings again, and for the same reason the config guard above takes both.

# ---- the offline half, FIRST -------------------------------------------------------
# Everything below this line to the live preamble runs without a network: flag gates,
# the idle lifecycle, the two halves of the user-level store, --version, and the host allowlist.
# It used to sit AFTER ~15 live engine round trips, so the most common regression of all —
# a gate or an envelope broken by the edit you are about to commit — cost 80 seconds to see.
# The gates are still red within the first seconds; the half as a whole is the figure in the
# header, with no network call made.
#
# It is also a HALF you can run on its own, which is the point of --offline: the boundary was
# already load-bearing, and a boundary nobody can stop at is a boundary only the author uses.
#
# THE ORDER IS PART OF THE FILE, not an accident of how it grew:
#   · offline first, so a broken gate is red before anything is fetched;
#   · the TUI section LAST, driven in a real tmux session.
# Moving a section is therefore a deliberate act.

# ── ARCH-player.md「终端可视化」's five worked calls, each run once. The PICTURE those
# lines are about needs a real resolve and a real tty, so it stays 实测 in that doc — a
# foreground blocking play with no --length is not time this suite spends, and bounding it
# would take a stand-in it does not keep. What CAN be held here is the half that rots
# silently: that each of those argv lines is still ACCEPTED — every flag parsed, every
# combination legal, the call travelling all the way to the engine.
#
# The claim is the MESSAGE, for the reason the scalar-knob loop above states: a rejected flag
# and a refused host both exit 1, so an exit code cannot separate "this combination is legal"
# and "one of these flags is not", and a check that cannot separate them cannot fail. The
# handle is the check's own — a host no engine claims, which keeps every one of these offline
# (the engine's host gate answers before yt-dlp is reached; measured at 0.05s) while still
# proving the call got past t-play entirely. Reaching the ENGINE is the pass, and the engine
# NAME in the message is what makes the --engine line more than a repeat of the first.
#
# LC_ALL is PINNED, and that is not decoration: -f viz refuses a non-UTF-8 locale (tct draws
# in half blocks), so on a machine running under LC_ALL=C every line below would come back red
# for a reason that is the environment's and not the subject's — the worst failure a suite can
# have. Pinning also costs nothing to make honest: the gate reads the variable, it does not
# require the locale to be installed, so this works on a host that has no en_US at all. The
# locale gate gets its own check further down, where refusing IS the claim.
# The dead proxy rides along for the auto-route checks: their handles are real hosts of a real
# shape (BV…, song?id=…, watch?v=…), so the claiming engine would otherwise go on to a live
# extraction — three network calls in --offline, reading the developer's own browser cookies,
# for a message ("could not resolve") that any resolve failure prints the same.

# ── A PASTE IS TEXT, NOT KEYS ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Hermetic because the STARTUP prompt is up before any search: ting asks for a query with
# nothing fetched, so the whole claim is provable with no packet sent.
#
# The payload carries a NEWLINE, and that is what makes the check discriminating rather than
# decorative. A build with bracketed paste off is not a build that mangles the text — tmux
# would simply deliver the bytes raw and the prompt would show `jazz` — so a single-line
# payload passes either way and proves nothing. With a line break in it the two builds part
# company: the fixed one joins the lines with a space and stays at the prompt, the broken one
# submits `jazz` on the newline and leaves the prompt for a search. Asserting on ONE LINE
# reading `jazz #ch` therefore fails for both halves of the bug this pins — the terminal mode
# never being asked for, and the prompt reading the paste's \e[200~ opener as its cancel key.
#
# `#` in the payload is not incidental: it is a bound key (row numbers) in the list, which is
# where a pasted query used to be run as commands, and keeping it here documents the class.
#
# The SAME pane then proves the other half of the Esc contract, and it is a clock claim: how
# long the prompt takes to close. `read -t` on the bash 3.2 floor takes whole seconds, so the
# reader that waits to see whether a byte follows an Esc held the prompt open for a full one
# before cancelling — and at the startup prompt nothing ever follows an Esc, because the app
# is leaving, so it was paid every time (measured 1062 ms from the keypress to exit; a second
# of dead terminal before the shell prompt returns reads as a hang). 600 ms is the
# discriminating bound: unreachable for a one-second wait, and four times the ~130 ms the
# tty-timed reader takes. It is spent as ONE sleep and ONE capture rather than a poll loop —
# a loop's own forks would inflate the very window being measured.

# or four, and nearly every assertion below is about an envelope's SHAPE. Two identical
# queries cannot answer a shape question differently, so each query is fetched once and
# interrogated as many times as it has claims. The command is still the real entry point and
# the answer is still its real stdout.
#
# A call keeps its own invocation when its ARGV differs (-j and -J are two envelopes, not two
# questions about one), when its ENVIRONMENT differs (the proxy checks), or when its INPUT
# differs (a second query, chosen for content the first one does not have).
#
# AND THEY ALL GO OUT TOGETHER. Twenty-odd of these calls have no dependency on each other —
# they ask different engines different questions — and run one after another they were most
# of this file's wall clock: ~70s of a ~130s run, spent waiting on a network that was idle
# between calls. They are fired as background jobs and collected once; the assertions below
# read the answers off disk, in the order they always read them, and are not otherwise
# touched. What is NOT here is anything whose input is another fetch's output (the offset
# block picks its handle out of a search) — that goes in the second wave, after this one.
#
# The suite's own runtime is not a claim: nothing below asserts on how long a fetch took

#
#   · `kind`/`access` are the ENGINE'S JUDGEMENT about a row (ARCH-cli-contract.md「数据契约」), which

#     that adds them to the projection alone hands the caller who asked for MORE data (-J) an
#     envelope missing two required fields, and every -j check in this file stays green.
#   · A row whose `url` is null is not a row: `t-play` has nothing to call. bili-search
#     shipped exactly that — search_type=video mixes in `ketang` (paid-course) records that
#     carry no `bvid`, 3 of 20 on "钢琴", and an EMPTY bvid is TRUTHY in jq, so the `.id !=
#     null` gate passed them through with `id: ""` and `url: null`.
#   · A row with NO LENGTH AND NO REASON is not a row either, and this is the clause that
#     catches a CONTAINER — the shape a buildable url gets past the check above. A playable
#     call either has a duration or says why it has none: a live stream carries
#     live_status "is_live" with duration null, an archived one carries "was_live" with a
#     number. A channel row carries NEITHER (measured 2026-09-03: row 15 of 周杰伦 on
#     yt-search is the artist's channel — duration null, and yt-dlp does not even put the
#     live_status key on that entry, while every video entry beside it has it). That is the
#     engine-independent way to say "a row is a playable call" without any site knowledge
#     leaking in here: this file must not know what a /channel/ url looks like.
#
# Asserted against the CLOSED ENUM, never against `has("kind")`: an engine writing
# kind:"video" — the site's own word, the likeliest wrong answer — satisfies presence and

    # (view_count) differs from the pinned one (relevance), so the check cannot pass by
    # accident — which is exactly what a file that agreed with the environment would do.
    # YT_LANG=en pins the pane's CHROME LANGUAGE. Every assertion in this section used to be
    # language-neutral by necessity — the default is "zh under a zh* locale, English
    # otherwise", so the pane spoke whichever language the machine did, and a check that named
    # a chrome string would have been green on one host and red on the next. The `i` checks
    # below need to name one (the `i` view's own label, and a field the list cannot hold), so
    # the language becomes an input rather than an accident. Nothing else in the
    # section reads a chrome string, so nothing else changes.
    # UT_IMAGE=on, and it is the discriminating value rather than the realistic one: `auto`
    # under tmux returns before sending a byte, so it would prove nothing, while `on` runs
    # the whole cover path — the cell-size query, the fetch, the transcode, the emit — on a
    # pane this block already drives through a resize, a filter and nine preference keys.
    #
    # WHAT IT CANNOT SEE IS WHAT THE PICTURE LOOKS LIKE — not whether one was sent. The
    # distinction is `capture-pane` versus `pipe-pane`, and this comment used to get it
    # wrong: capture-pane renders the GRID, and a placement is not in the grid, so a check
    # written against it could never fail; pipe-pane copies the bytes the program WROTE
    # before tmux decides what to do with them, so the escapes are readable even though tmux
    # forwards none of them. Two checks further down use exactly that. What stays out of
    # reach is the rendering — position, scale, whether it is the right image — which is a
    # picture and not a byte, and no suite here proves it.
    #
    # What forcing `on` catches is the cover path BREAKING THE TUI, and on the day the draw
    # path landed it caught three separate ways, none of them predicted:
    #   · `ls … | head -1` on a cold cache — an unmatched pipeline under pipefail carries
    #     ITS status, `set -e` takes the process, and the frame dies mid-detail-block;
    #   · the transcode's mpv sharing this tty and EATING KEYS, so # and v stopped toggling
    #     (--really-quiet does not cover it: that is output, this is input — --no-terminal);
    #   · a 39KB base64 write interrupted by SIGCHLD/SIGWINCH — `printf: write error:
    #     Interrupted system call` — again fatal under set -e.
    # Every one of them shows up here as this block's own boot / key / quit assertions going
    # red, which is why the value of forcing `on` is not that it draws but that it runs.
    # BOTH names of every redirection, in every pane of this file. The loader reads TING_ before
    # UT_, and a pane gets the tmux SERVER's environment, not this shell's — so the `unset` at

    # `Space Down i` as one burst; the keys were read in order (that was never the bug) but
    # the settle condition was `no chapters` being on screen, and that text stays up until
    # the next redraw — so a lap's first capture could match the PREVIOUS lap's notice, call
    # itself settled in milliseconds, and fire the next lap on top of an in-flight fetch
    # (measured both ways 2026-09-03: honest ~3.1s laps in one run, an instant advance in
    # another, a capture being 30-60ms). It was then fixed by waiting for the notice to be
    # gone — which worked, and which was this file paying interest on a design debt: the
    # notice owned a blocking read, so the walk had to feed it a Space before the TUI would
    # accept another key. The notice is now a line in the frame that the next key clears
    # (ROADMAP.md「横切规范」只为一个答案停下来), so both the Space and the wait are gone.
    #
    # WHICH MAKES THE `Down` BELOW THE DISCRIMINATING INPUT for that design, not a step in
    # the walk: it is sent straight after the notice with nothing in between, so a build
    # whose notice still ate a keypress would spend this key dismissing it, the cursor would
